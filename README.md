# TRI-Egregious-Polluters

My code from an environmental sociology investigation lead by Professor Simone Pulver into whether some facilities in the Toxics Releases Industry database pollute significantly more than others and what may be the underlying characteristics of these facilities. 

Authors: Simone Pulver (lead of the project), Jeffrey Wu (quantitative lead), Mary Burke, Dustin Hill (contributors to previous projects)

This project builds on Professor Pulver's work on the topic, see (insert reference). In this project, Professor Pulver wanted to conduct a more rigorous statistical analysis to characterize "egregious polluters" and identify characteristics that are significant predictors of egregious polluter status, so she sought me out to be the quantitative lead for this project. The analysis is split into the two files included in this repository:
